## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! This repository represents my work as a machine learning engineer focused on building end-to-end ML pipelines using scikit-learn and Pandas. The goal of this project is to demonstrate best practices in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation within a clean, modular workflow.

The pipeline begins with data wrangling using Pandas, where raw datasets are cleaned, transformed, and structured for modeling. This includes handling missing values, outlier detection, type conversions, and encoding categorical variables. Special attention is given to ensuring data integrity and reproducibility throughout the preprocessing steps.

Next, the project emphasizes robust feature engineeringâ€”the critical step of extracting and transforming input variables to enhance model performance. Techniques such as scaling, polynomial feature expansion, interaction terms, and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) are explored. Feature selection methods, including variance thresholds and model-based selection, are also implemented to reduce noise and improve generalization.

Model development is handled using scikit-learnâ€™s pipeline architecture, which allows for clean chaining of preprocessing and modeling steps. This ensures that transformations are applied consistently during training and inference, reducing data leakage and improving maintainability. A range of algorithmsâ€”logistic regression, decision trees, ensemble methods, and moreâ€”are evaluated in a standardized framework.

Finally, the project focuses on model evaluation and validation, using cross-validation, grid search, and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices to assess performance comprehensively. Visualizations and reports help interpret results and guide model refinement.

Whether you're new to machine learning or looking for a structured reference on building reliable pipelines, this repository offers practical examples grounded in real-world workflows. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
